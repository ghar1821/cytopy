"""Static matplotlib figures: biaxial plots, gate overlays, and QC lines.

The napari viewer is for looking around; this is for the figures that go into
a report and stay put. Both draw the same thing the same way -- a smoothed 2-D
histogram from :func:`~cytopy.density_image` -- so a plot in a report matches
what was on screen when the gate was drawn.

Biaxial plots are coloured by event density by default. At a few million
events a per-point scatter is neither fast nor readable: the interesting
structure is where events pile up, and only a density does that honestly.

    """A two-channel plot, coloured by event density.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adata
        Events x channels AnnData.
    x, y
        Channels for the two axes. Any alias :func:`~cytopy.channel_index`
        accepts.
    layer
        Matrix to plot, by name -- ``"raw"``, ``"comp"``, ``"asinh"``, or
        ``"X"`` for the working matrix. Required: a plot should say which
        matrix it is of. Values are plotted as stored;
        the axes are labelled in raw units when the layer records its
        transform, exactly as in the viewer.
    cofactor
        Arcsinh the two channels for display only, and put the ticks back in
        raw units. Nothing is written to ``adata`` -- this is for plotting raw
        counts on a biexponential axis without materialising a layer for it,
        which on a run of millions of events is worth avoiding.
    color_by
        ``"density"`` (default) shades a smoothed 2-D histogram, which is the
        only thing that stays readable at millions of events. Otherwise the
        name of a boolean ``obs`` column -- a gate, or the bead mask -- which
        draws that group as points over a grey density of everything else,
        so a report can show what a step removed.
    subset
        Boolean mask, or the name of a boolean ``obs`` column, limiting the
        events drawn. ``None`` draws all of them.
    gate
        Gate name, or names, whose outline to draw over the plot. Gates
        recorded on channels other than ``x`` and ``y`` are skipped, since
        their outline would not mean anything here.
    rectangles
        Outlines to draw as ``(x_lo, x_hi, y_lo, y_hi)``, in plotted
        coordinates -- for a gate held as ranges rather than vertices, such as
        a bead gate.
    bins
        Resolution of the density, per axis.
    smooth
        Gaussian smoothing of the density, in bins.
    log
        Shade ``log1p(count)``, so rare populations stay visible.
    cmap
        Colormap for the density.
    robust
        Clip the axes to the 0.1-99.9th percentile, so a few extreme events
        cannot flatten the plot. Ignored on whichever axis has an explicit
        ``xlim``/``ylim``.
    xlim, ylim
        Explicit display-coordinate limits, overriding the ones ``robust``
        would otherwise compute. For sharing one scale across several panels,
        e.g. the same detector's axis across every control in
        :func:`plot_compensation`.
    title
        Axes title. Defaults to the event count.
    seed
        Seed for thinning a highlighted population down to ``MAX_SCATTER``
        points, so the same events are drawn each time.
    ax
        Existing axes to draw on; one is created when omitted.

    Returns
    -------
    matplotlib.axes.Axes
        The axes drawn on.

    Raises
    ------
    KeyError
        If ``color_by`` or ``subset`` names a column that is not in ``obs``.

    spillover
        The matrix to try, in any form :func:`~cytopy.compensate` accepts.
    unstained
        Universal negative, drawn nowhere but used to place the line when a
        control has no negative events of its own.
    cofactor
        Arcsinh cofactor for the display. Display only -- compensation happens
        on the raw values.
    positive_gate
        ``obs`` column marking each control's positive events. Falls back to
        splitting the stained channel at its midpoint, which is only used to
        place the reference line.
    bins
        Resolution of each panel's density.
    max_events
        Events drawn per panel. ``None`` draws all of them; either way, axis
        ranges are always taken from every event, not just the ones drawn.
    seed
        Seed for that per-panel draw, so the same events are plotted each time.
