"""Spillover matrices: derive one from single-stain controls, or read one in.

There are three ways to get a matrix, in increasing order of effort:

* the acquisition software already computed one and wrote it into the FCS
  file, where :func:`~cytopy.read_fcs` picks it up as ``adata.uns['spillover']``;
* some other program exported one, and :func:`read_spillover` reads its CSV;
* you have the single-stain controls, and :func:`compute_spillover_matrix`
  computes one from them by the Bagwell and Adams method.

All three produce the same thing: a square DataFrame indexed by detector, with
``1`` on the diagonal, where ``S[i, j]`` is the fraction of dye *i*'s signal
that lands in detector *j*. :func:`~cytopy.compensate` takes it from there.

    For the control stained with dye *i*, the signal it contributes to every
    detector *j* is the difference between its positive and negative
    populations, ``d_j``. Dividing that row through by ``d_i`` — the difference
    in the dye's own detector — gives spillover coefficients that are
    independent of how bright the control happened to be, and puts ``1`` on the
    diagonal by construction. Inverting the assembled matrix is what
    :func:`~cytopy.compensate` then does, which is the N-parameter
    generalisation Bagwell and Adams (1993) described.

    The negative population is taken from the control itself, which is what you
    want: it carries the same autofluorescence and the same beads as the
    positives. Pass ``unstained`` to use a universal negative instead.

    Parameters
    ----------
    controls
        Maps detector to its single-stain control — ``{"FITC-A": adata}``, or
        a path to the FCS file instead of an ``AnnData``. The key is resolved
        like any other channel name, so ``$PnS`` markers (``"CD3"``) work too.
        :func:`read_controls` builds this mapping from a directory.
    unstained
        Universal negative, as an ``AnnData`` or a path. When given, its
        per-channel statistic is the negative reference for every control
        rather than each control's own negative events.
    channels
        Detectors the matrix should cover. Defaults to the controls' own
        detectors, which is the only square set the controls constrain. A
        larger set is allowed — the extra detectors get identity rows, which
        asserts they spill into nothing.
    layer
        Layer of each control to measure, by name. Defaults to ``"raw"``:
        a matrix is derived from the values as acquired.
    statistic
        ``"median"`` (default, robust) or ``"mean"`` (as in the original
        paper). Applied to both populations.
    positive_gate
        Name of a boolean ``obs`` column marking the stained events, as
        written by :func:`~cytopy.add_gate`. Falls back to the automatic split
        for any control that lacks the column.
    thresholds
        Per-control cutoff on the stained detector, in raw units, keyed like
        ``controls``. Overrides the automatic split. Pass ``-inf`` for a tube
        with no negative population of its own — an all-positive bead control
        — which only works alongside ``unstained``.
    cofactor
        Arcsinh cofactor for the automatic positive/negative split. It only
        affects where the split is looked for, never the returned
        coefficients; raise it if a dim control is being cut in the wrong
        place.
    min_events
        Smallest acceptable positive or negative population. A control below
        it cannot give a trustworthy median and is an error rather than a
        quietly bad row of the matrix.
    min_separation
        How far apart the automatic split must put the two populations, in
        negative-MAD units, before the control is believed to be stained at
        all. **Off by default**: the measure does not do the job it looks like
        it does. On real controls a dim but genuine tube scores 3.5 while an
        unstained tube scores 6.7, so any cutoff that passes the real one also
        passes the empty one. It is kept for clean bead controls, where the two
        are orders apart. The check that a control is brighter than its own
        negatives always applies, and is the one that catches a mismatched
        tube. Only consulted when the split is automatic -- an explicit
        ``positive_gate`` or ``thresholds`` entry is taken at face value.

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
        Square spillover matrix indexed and columned by the resolved detector
        names, with ``1`` on the diagonal. ``.attrs['cytopy']`` carries the
        per-control event counts and thresholds for troubleshooting.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If ``controls`` is empty, a control does not separate into two
        populations, a control's own detector shows no signal above its
        negatives, or ``channels`` omits a detector that has a control.
    KeyError
        If a control is missing one of the detectors being solved for.

    The step between gating and computing a matrix: what comes back holds the
    cells and nothing else, so every median the matrix is built from is a

    Parameters
    ----------
    controls
        Maps detector to its control.
    gate
        ``obs`` column to subset on, as gated with :func:`~cytopy.gate`.
    required
        Raise if a control has no such column. ``False`` passes it through
        whole, which is rarely what you want and never silent -- a control that
        was missed makes a quietly wrong matrix rather than an error.

    Returns
    -------
    dict

    Raises
    ------
    KeyError
        If ``required`` and a control was never gated.

    Compensated values are ``X @ inv(S)``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adata
        Cytometry AnnData.
    spillover
        Square spillover matrix, in any of the forms cytopy can get one:

        * ``None`` (default) uses ``adata.uns['spillover']``, which
          :func:`~cytopy.read_fcs` parses from the file's ``$SPILLOVER``;
        * a DataFrame, whose index/columns name the detectors and need only
          cover a subset of the channels — as returned by
          :func:`~cytopy.compute_spillover_matrix`, which derives one from
          single-stain controls;
        * a path to a CSV exported by other software, read with
          :func:`~cytopy.read_spillover`;
        * a bare array, assumed to be in :func:`fluor_channels` order.
    layer
        Input layer to read from, by name. Defaults to ``"raw"``: compensation
        undoes crosstalk in the values as acquired, so it belongs on the
        untouched matrix rather than on whatever has been done since.
    key_added
        Layer to write the compensated matrix to.
    inplace
        Modify ``adata`` and return it. The default is ``False``: the original
        is left alone and a modified copy is returned, so a call that is not
        assigned to anything cannot quietly change the data underneath you.

    Returns
    -------
    AnnData
        The annotated object, with the compensated matrix in
        ``adata.layers[key_added]`` and where the matrix came from in
        ``adata.uns['cytopy']['spillover_source']``. Channels absent from the
        matrix are copied through untouched.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If no matrix is given and the file recorded none, if the matrix is not
        square, if its rows and columns do not name the same detectors, or if
        it cannot be inverted.

    Compensate a single-stain control correctly and its positive population
